# C++ Practice
There are some practice for the book `C++ Primer Plus`.

## Run
If you want to run them, just like run normal single file cpp source code.

For example:
```bash
git clone https:://github.com/Hello-world150/cpp_practice.git
cd cpp_practice
cd <chapter_dir>
g++ <source_code>
./a.out
```

You should replace the words in <> into proper name.
Also, you should have a cpp compiler, recommend g++.

These codes have not been tested on Windows with msvc.
